#Comedy Bot Bot
This is a twitter bot that uploads screenshot(s) or a video from comedy bang bang every day. You can easily repurpose this for 
a different thing since the media is not included.

Create a folder in the screens directory with up to 4 images in it, and these will be posted together (make sure they are in the 
proper order alphabetically)

Or just add videos to the vids directory. MP4 only, limited to 140 seconds (I know right lol) and 15MB by the twitter API

twitter_dist.json should be renamed to twitter.json and you should put in your own API keys. That's pretty much it.
